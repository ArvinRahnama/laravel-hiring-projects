# NewsChallenge

**Project Description:**  
A Laravel application designed to retrieve and display news from two different sources. The project uses Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and Filament for admin resources. This application includes a `User` model for authentication and a `News` model for handling news articles. The project is built to allow scheduling tasks with Laravel's built-in scheduler.

## Configuration

### Filament Resource Configuration

To generate a Filament resource for the `User` and `News` models, use the following commands:

- **User Resource:**

    ```bash
    php artisan make:filament-resource User --view --generate
    ```

- **News Resource:**

    ```bash
    php artisan make:filament-resource News --view --generate
    ```

These commands will create resources in the `app/Filament/Resources` directory and generate the necessary views.

## Filament Resources

Filament resources provide an easy-to-use interface for managing your models. The generated resources include the ability to create, read, update, and delete records.

## Running Cron Jobs

To run the scheduler locally, use:

```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```

## Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind CSS is integrated via CDN, so there's no need for npm commands. Simply include the Tailwind CSS CDN link in your HTML files:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@3.2.1/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

All Tailwind CSS classes can be used directly in your HTML without any additional configuration.
